I’m a Robotics Controls Engineer passionate about building intelligent, reliable, and safe autonomous systems. My interests lie at the intersection of control theory, planning, and optimization, with applications across UAVs, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. I specialize in designing provably safe control and planning/learning algorithms from the ground up—leveraging tools from control theory, optimization, vehicle dynamics, and learning-based methods to solve real-world challenges in autonomous navigation, flight control, and decision-making.

# Bio 

I'm a Controls Engineer for robotics, autonomous vehicles and UAVS. I love designing safe crtical control and planning algorithms from ground up using tools from control theory, optimization, vehicle dynamics, robotics, learning and planning. I'm interested in the intersection of theory and applications. I enjoy developing practical and safe algorithms and apply them to solve real problems in autonomous vehicle controls, flight controls, navigation, decision making, autonomy and robotics. I have developed, implemented and published various trajectory tracking control and planning and coordination algorithms for both mutli-rotors and mobile robots/vehicles using LQR, PID, MPC, Adaptive, Nonlinear, Path planning based on clothoids, differential flatness, splines and so on using C++, Python, ROS/Gazebo, MATLAB/Simulink both in simulation and real time system using PX4, dSpace, C++/ROS.

I received my Masters in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Oklahoma State University working under Dr. He Bai at the CoRAL Lab from Aug 2016 to Dec 2018. I worked very closely with Dr. Rushikesh Kamalapurkar (currently at UF) and J.Á. Acosta at Universidad de Sevilla (Spain). 

During my M.S. I worked on Aerial robotics and Control with focus on cooperative aerial manipulation and control of muti-agents. We published 3 peer-reviewed conference paper and 2 journal

# Current Research Interest 

My  interest lies in the intersection of control, planning, learning for autonomous systems. I’m interested in the balance between theoretical analysis and practical implementation on hardware systems in a multi-disciplinary environment. My overall goal is to be a full stack controls and robotics researcher using tools ranging from control design, autonomous planning, decision making and implementation on real-time hardware systems. 

In general I'm interested in both deep theoretical foundations and practical applications.

- Control and planning of autonomous systems, nonlinear, adaptive and optimal control

- Distributed Controls and Estimation

- Multi-vehicle coordination and control

- Trajectory optimization and motion planning 

- Aerial Robotics and Robot Autonomy 

- Planning/Decision making under uncertainty
